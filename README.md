# ShortestPathGeneticAlgorithm

A simple web app made with HTML/CSS/JS that uses a genetic algorithm to determine the (not so) shortest path between two points on a grid with obstacles.

## How to use
Simply download the repository and load the HTML webpage onto your browser. Select start location and place it on the grid, followed by an end location, and any obstacles. Press "Start Genetic Algorithm" and it will run through 100 generations with a starting population of 3000 random paths generated by BFS. Note that this algorithm is clearly suboptimal for this use case, and often any reasonable path ends up going extinct due to mutations. You may need to run the algorithm a few times before you see a result.
